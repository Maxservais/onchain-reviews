This Attestation-Based Dapp Rating web app allows anyone to review dApps and tools - with all reviews stored onchain (on OP mainnet or Base, though other networks can be configured). By leveraging the Ethereum Attestation Service, users can share their experiences 100% onchain which offers

- **Transparency**: Reviews are tamper-proof and verifiable by anyone.
- **Composability**: Onchain reviews can be seamlessly integrated into various projects, enabling a richer ecosystem of interconnected dApps.

You can see this in action on a real-production app on [Ethereum Ecosystem](https://www.ethereum-ecosystem.com/apps/coinbase#reviews), where users can check and leave reviews for various dApps and tools.
